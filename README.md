# Elytra Project Skeleton

*Spooky scary skeletons*

A generic Gradle buildfile and a fairly sane project structure to make
getting started easier. Rather than making a new empty directory and
copying your Forge dev files over, just clone this repository instead.
Cloning and keeping the commit history means that updating to new versions
of the skeleton is a simple `git pull`.

Make sure to replace the README.md and decide if the MIT License is what
you want to use. If it is, replace the copyright declaration to have your
name instead of unascribed's.

Don't edit build.gradle, just edit project.gradle.
